        high-resolution photograph of a golden retriever sitting in the cockpit of
        a rocket, looking out the window with an excited expression. The rocket is
        launching, surrounded by flames and smoke, against a night sky filled with
        stars. The dog wears a small astronaut helmet and is the central focus of
        the image, with the moon visible in the background. The scene is set during
        the night, enhancing the dramatic effect of the launch without any distracting
        foreground elements or additional text. The composition ensures the dog''s
        face and the rocket''s interior are well-lit, emphasizing the main subject
        while maintaining a realistic and engaging space environment."}]}'
